"article": "A Tour of Machine Learning Algorithms\nby Jason Brownlee on October 11, 2023 in Machine Learning Algorithms 359\n Tweet Share\nIn this post, we will take a tour of the most popular machine learning algorithms.\n\nIt is useful to tour the main algorithms in the field to get a feeling of what methods are available.\n\nThere are so many algorithms that it can feel overwhelming when algorithm names are thrown around and you are expected to just know what they are and where they fit.\n\nI want to give you two ways to think about and categorize the algorithms you may come across in the field.\n\nThe first is a grouping of algorithms by their learning style.\nThe second is a grouping of algorithms by their similarity in form or function (like grouping similar animals together).\nBoth approaches are useful, but we will focus in on the grouping of algorithms by similarity and go on a tour of a variety of different algorithm types.\n\nAfter reading this post, you will have a much better understanding of the most popular machine learning algorithms for supervised learning and how they are related.\n\nKick-start your project with my new book Master Machine Learning Algorithms, including step-by-step tutorials and the Excel Spreadsheet files for all examples.\n\nLet\u2019s get started.\n\nEnsemble Learning Method\nA cool example of an ensemble of lines of best fit. Weak members are grey, the combined prediction is red.\nPlot from Wikipedia, licensed under public domain.\n\nAlgorithms Grouped by Learning Style\nThere are different ways an algorithm can model a problem based on its interaction with the experience or environment or whatever we want to call the input data.\n"
